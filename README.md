# ValeriaOS Engine
ValeriaOS is a modular engine designed to be used as a framework and foundation for your Ro-City and other type of Roblox games. This allows you, as a developer, to create your own add-on scripts to the engine and utilize the engine's functions and APIs with minimal effort and complexness. In other word, making and plugging your add-on script to the engine is a very easy thing to do without having to directly edit the core codes for a(n) new feature or functionality.

Documentations will be made after the Alpha version is released. This is not completed project and will have a lot of bugs so keep that in mind when using ValeriaOS Engine! Any contributions to the project is greatly appreciated.

Please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/KingColton1/ValeriaOS/issues">issues page</a>. Thanks for helping with finding bugs!
